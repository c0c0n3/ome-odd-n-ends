Presentation I gave on 14 Nov 2017 about leveraging Smuggler messaging
infrastructure to build scalable and resilient software.

Each SVG file contains a slide---`1.svg` 1st slide, `2.svg` 2nd, etc. The
`empty-slide.svg` is the base document template I used for each slide. To
make it look like the SVG fills the whole browser window, I set document

* `height` and `width` to `100%`
* background colour to `style="background: #3c4747;"`

Also, I added a `style` block to import the fonts I used: Kaushan Script,
Cherry Cream Soda, Ubuntu Mono, and Ubuntu Condensed.  `empty-slide.svg`
