Montpellier, October the 5th 2015



Dear Professor Swedlow,

We are writing to express our support for the OME Consortium's proposal to improve
and extend the OME software suite. We have successfully implemented an OME site
here at Montpellier RIO Imaging (MRI), the largest multi-site imaging facility in
France, providing access to the latest technology in imaging and cytometry for
research in biology, health care and agronomy. With over 700 active users, more
than 60 acquisition systems and 28 employees, MRI provides equipment and expertise
to 46 research institutes, universities, hospitals and three enterprises.
Associated with MRI, the MARS imaging facility provides access to the latest
non-commercial developments in the field of bio-imaging.

The adoption of OME has proven key to overcoming data management and analysis
challenges that we were facing as a result of the sheer size and complexity of
our structure, to the point that we are now committed to scaling our initial OME
installation to become MRI's main infrastructure for data storage, management and
analysis. Moreover, we are planning to have several OME installations cooperate
seamlessly to better serve our imaging community.
In fact, we envision that federated OME sites will be the backbone of a
distributed system that will allow biologists to store, retrieve, and process
their data across European research institutions. This is in line with France
Bio-Imaging's plans to build distributed infrastructure for biological imaging,
which is a priority in the research development strategy of the French National
Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS).
(MRI is part of France Bio-Imaging, the French chapter of the Euro Bio-Imaging
initiative.)

In view of the above, we welcome and support your proposal to extend OME with
the ability to federate distributed data sources as we see it as a necessary
and fundamental step to achieve our goals.

In closing, we wish to thank you and the whole OME team for the impressive work
you have done so far and express our appreciation for your unrelenting efforts
to build the infrastructure necessary to move science forward.

Yours sincerely,
