OMERO implementation in a large multi-site imaging facility
===========================================================

Montpellier RIO Imaging (MRI) is a multi-site imaging core facility that provides access
to the latest technology in imaging and cytometry for research in biology, health care
and agronomy. With over 700 active users, more than 60 acquisition systems and 28
employees, it provides equipment and expertise to 46 research institutes, universities
and hospitals and 3 enterprises, mainly, but not only, in the area of Montpellier.
Associated with MRI, the MARS imaging facility provides access to the latest,
non-commercial, developments in the field of bio-imaging. MRI is perhaps the largest
imaging core facility in France and among the first ones to have been established as such.

Due to the sheer size and complexity of our structure, our staff is facing an increasing
number of data management and analysis challenges. At MRI, we are committed to adopting
OMERO as the main infrastructure for storage, management and analysis of our data in order
to overcome these challenges. We also plan to participate in the development of OMERO to
better serve the specific needs of our local imaging community. We will share our plans in
our presentation and hope to gather feedback, suggestions, and similar experiences of large
scale implementations from the OME community.
