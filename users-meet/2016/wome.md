Web of Open Microscopy Environments (WOME?!)
===================================

- produce data to discover
- web made it obvious that sharing accelerates the building of new knowledge
- ome is open but not connected = inter-linked, e.g. reference data in other
  ome site.
- *lots* of *diverse* data, you'll need *both* humans and machines to mine
- potential, challenges, and opportunities
  - opportunity:
    crowdsource the finding of similarities in imaging data; might work cos
    lots of people are affected by diseases this kind of research studies,
    e.g. cancer.

Information Age
---------------
- Automated digital technologies allowed vast increases in the rapidity of
  information growth
- Though the Internet itself has existed since 1969, it was with the invention
  of the World Wide Web in 1989 that the Internet became an *easily accessible*
  network.
  The Internet is now a *global* platform for *accelerating* the *flow of information*

Concept
-------
Scientific knowledge is produced not only by studying phenomena in isolation but
also (crucially!) by discovering relationships among them. After knowledge has
been extracted from isolated data sets, often even more can be discovered once
these data are brought together and mined.
(E.g. Darwin relates species, variations, and habitat; he then reasons that
species may adapt to changes in the environment, leading to alterations of the
race...)

Computers allow scientists to acquire ever increasing amounts of data to make
observations and test predictions. But computers have also accelerated the
process (once performed by humans only!) of data aggregation, correlation, and
pattern discovery, resulting in new knowledge being produced at unprecedented
rates in many fields.
Perhaps, the most exciting fact about "Big Data" is not that we are producing
oceans of bytes, but rather that there are potentially many interesting
relationships among diverse data sets which are yet to be discovered and
availability of these data sets for analysis makes discovery possible. The key
observation here is that aggregating data sources may lead to the acquisition of
new knowledge that would not have been possible to extract from each individual
data source in isolation.
(Darwin had to examine many diverse data sets to put together the pieces of the
evolution puzzle.)

OME and "Big Data"
------------------
OME has undoubtedly proven its value as a data management and integration
platform, but also has the potential to deliver a solid foundation for mining
biological imaging data sets aggregated from different studies. A case in point
is the IDR project which aims to extract feature sets out of multiple studies
with the hope to deliver some measure of similarity in terms of image structure,
dynamics, and components. But traditionally biologists who do imaging tend to
work on their own data sets in isolation, producing knowledge that is eventually
distilled in a published paper and connections among different studies may only
be realised much later down the line by someone examining those studies. Even
then, much could potentially still remain undiscovered simply because all the
relevant data supporting those studies (images and analysis) is not available.




What does all this have to do with OME? Before answering that question...

- note:
  - imaging experiments traditionally done in isolation, no sharing
  - aggregation & mining of knowledge carried out by humans (read paper, make
    connection)
  - possibly many interesting relationships could emerge if data sets were
    brought together
- IDR great example of potential of OME tech to accelerate scientific discovery
  - make data available
  - aggregate
  - analysis
  - indeed IDR aims to extract feature sets out of multiple studies with the
    hope to deliver some measure of similarity in terms of image structure,
    dynamics, and components

Even "Bigger Data"
------------------
WOME
  - can we push all this even further?
  - Web good example of sharing, aggregation, etc. (*easy* both for programmers
    and non-programmers)
