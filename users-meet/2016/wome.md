Web of Open Microscopy Environments (WOME?!)
===================================

- produce data to discover
- web made it obvious that sharing accelerates the building of new knowledge
- ome is open but not connected = inter-linked, e.g. reference data in other
  ome site.
- *lots* of *diverse* data, you'll need *both* humans and machines to mine
- potential, challenges, and opportunities
  - opportunity:
    crowdsource the finding of similarities in imaging data; might work cos
    lots of people are affected by diseases this kind of research studies,
    e.g. cancer.

Information Age
---------------
- Automated digital technologies allowed vast increases in the rapidity of
  information growth
- Though the Internet itself has existed since 1969, it was with the invention
  of the World Wide Web in 1989 that the Internet became an *easily accessible*
  network.
  The Internet is now a *global* platform for *accelerating* the *flow of information*

Concept
-------
Scientific knowledge is produced not only by studying phenomena in isolation but
also (crucially!) by discovering relationships among them. After knowledge has
been extracted from isolated data sets, often even more can be discovered once
these data are brought together and mined.
(E.g. Darwin relates species, variations, and habitat; he then reasons that
species may adapt to changes in the environment, leading to alterations of the
race...)
