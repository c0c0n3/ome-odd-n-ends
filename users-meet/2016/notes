IDR = Image Data Repo
=====================

07:40 important to track which tools used for experiment, but not going to talk
      about it here

07:52 IDR => share & reuse *reference* image data sets.
08:40 why share? royal society, welcome trust => availability of research data!
09:34 sharing imaging data is very difficult:
      - large amounts
      - diversity: lots of different domains
      - data acquired as part of specific experiment, with perturbations
      - poorly standardised metadata
      - possibly poorly annotated
      - which data set to publish? (we don't publish our notebooks...)

17:47 architecture diagram
      - we work with gene-level similarities
      - gene ontologies can be used to connect data from different studies;
        output can be used for statistical analysis
      - if we can reduce or convert imaging data from multiple studies into some
        kind of annotated feature-set (e.g. polynomial to represent image
        structure), then can we find similarities in terms of image structure,
        dynamics, and components to deliver some measure of similarity?
      - have no answer yet, but that's the basis for what we're trying to do

23:40 big pharma: we could use this architecture to combine data from many data
      sets and feed into ML algorithms for compound activity prediction
      (ML need many integrated data sets to work well)

24:40 architecture diagram
      - collect lots of data
      - extract all features most people would want
      - make thumbnails + features available e.g. through web UI

26:19 architecture diagram
      - how to make data available for analysis though?
      - downloading won't work (TB's!)
      - make IDR available through Embassy: user runs their analysis in the
        cloud using provided tools (Matlab, CellProfiler, Python, etc.)
