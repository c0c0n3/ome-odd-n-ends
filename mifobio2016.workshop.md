Biological Imaging Data Management for Life Scientists and Facility Managers
============================================================================

Abstract
--------
The Open Microscopy Environment (OME) is an open-source software suite of
tools that enable access, analysis, visualisation, sharing and publication
of biological image data. OME has three components: (i) OME-TIFF, a standardised
file format and data model; (ii) Bio-Formats, a software library for reading
proprietary image file formats; (iii) OMERO, a software platform for image
data management and analysis.

In this workshop, we will present the OMERO platform and show how to import,
organise, view, search, annotate and publish imaging data. Additionally, we
will introduce how to use image processing tools such as ImageJ with OMERO. 
Finally, we will show how facility managers can use OMERO to manage users,
groups, and their microscopy, HCS and digital pathology data.

Keywords
--------
Image data management, OME, OMERO, ImageJ.

Audience
--------
Anyone wanting to use OMERO to organise, view, annotate and publish imaging
data. Any Facility Managers wanting to train users or wanting to use OMERO
for image data management.

Description
-----------
This workshop aims to show how to use OMERO to organise, view, annotate,
share and publish imaging data. The following topics will be covered:

1. Importing image and HCS data, including automatic import or importing on
behalf of other users.
2. Organising, viewing and annotating data with OMERO.insight and OMERO.web,
automated tagging.
3. Searching for data within OMERO.
4. Exporting data: OME-TIFF, JPEG, original image, ROI's, measurements.
5. Publishing data; creating figures for publication and sharing with
OMERO.figure; reusing figures.
6. Data analysis with OMERO scripts (Python, Matlab).
7. Integration with ImageJ: image processing and visualisation.
8. Overview of integration with other third-party applications: Matlab,
FLIMfit, CellProfiler, KNIME, Icy, Micro-Manager.
9. Group and user management, including directory services and stand-alone
systems.
10. How to set up an OMERO server: prerequisites, example setups, costs.
