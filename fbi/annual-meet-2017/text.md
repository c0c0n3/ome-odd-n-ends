Abstract
--------
We have extended the Open Microscopy Environment (OME) software suite with
a Web application to import images into OMERO. This new server application
exposes a REST API that allows any Web client to asynchronously trigger
image imports into any OMERO repository available on the network. Imports
are run on behalf of OMERO users but outside of their login sessions which
allows a user to log on an acquisition workstation, trigger the import and
then immediately log out without having to wait for the image data being
transferred out of the workstation into the OMERO repository. Thus, the
workstation (and the microscope) becomes immediately available to the next
user. Moreover, if users are billed for the time that they are logged on an
acquisition workstation, this new server application avoids the user paying
for the time that it takes to transfer their image data into OMERO.

The application is grounded on a reactive architecture designed with
scalability and resilience in mind in order to cope effectively with large
data volumes and workloads. This Web-based, message-driven design is generic
enough to be used for other data transfer and management tasks (e.g. FTP,
OMERO mass delete), to integrate heterogeneous applications, or as the
backbone of a task server.

Challenges
----------
* stay responsive without interferring with running acquisitions
* reliably import large data sets
* overcome transient failures
* provide back-pressure mechanism to avoid OMERO overload
* ensure outcome notifications
* scale horizontally to dozens of machines

A scalable and resilient architecture
-------------------------------------
We have overcome these challenges with a message-driven architecture whose
core is made up of

* a generic, strongly-typed messaging API with pluggable backing queueing
system;
* a run/retry/notify infrastructure built on top of it to schedule and
execute tasks;
* a REST front-end to expose this functionality.

Availability
------------
The server software is available as a Linux daemon, Windows service, or
as a generic distribution bundle. Moreover, we have released an OMERO
client (a fork of OMERO.Insight) that uses our server to import data
into OMERO in the background. From design blueprints to source code,
all our work is open-source and freely available on GitHub.

About OMERO
-----------
The OME Consortium develops OMERO, an open-source software suite for the
storage and manipulation of biological microscopy data.
From image acquisition to publication, OMERO provides the infrastructure
to manage the entire process in an automated, secure, and reliable fashion,
catering for the storage, transfer, management, visualisation, analysis,
sharing and publication of image data and metadata.

----------------
We are indebted to Jean-Marie Burel who designed and released a prototype
of the `OMERO.Insight` client to use our software for offline import.
Jean-Marie Burel, Josh Moore, and Sebastien Besson provided us with much
needed guidance around the inner workings of the OMERO platform as well as
countless useful suggestions.
