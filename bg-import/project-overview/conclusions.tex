\section{Conclusions}
Once implemented, the Background Import will increase availability of microscopes,
as users can log out just after image acquisition, and reduce operating costs, as
users will not have to pay for image data transfers. 
Thus we see how OMERO technology can help optimise cost and resource usage within a 
microscope facility by providing robust, feature-rich management of microscopy data. 
However, the benefits of adopting OMERO go far beyond: we see it as playing an important
role in facilitating scientific discovery. In fact, image data are ultimately acquired
to extract and derive information that forms the basis for scientific investigation. 
As data volumes grow and data formats proliferate, extracting information soon becomes
extremely difficult if the data are not accessible through a uniform, efficient 
interface which is exactly what OMERO provides, dramatically improving the ability 
to acquire knowledge form the data.
