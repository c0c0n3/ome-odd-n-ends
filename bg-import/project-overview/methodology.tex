\section{Methodology}

We are going to adopt the Kanban method (see e.g. \cite{anderson:kanban}) for software
development as this is the approach the OMERO team has embraced. The project will be
managed through the Redmine\cite{redmine:www} project management tool. Source code and
documentation will be kept in our GitHub repository at: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \url{https://github.com/c0c0n3/openmicroscopy}
\end{itemize}

The development tool chain is the same as that used by OMERO core developers.
