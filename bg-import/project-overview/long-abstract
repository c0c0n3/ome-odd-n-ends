The Background Importer is an extension of the Open Microscopy Environment software 
platform\cite{ome:www} that will allow to import images into the OMERO\cite{ome:omero-pub,
ome:omero-www} image repository without requiring experimenters to be logged onto the 
acquisition workstation. 
After images have been produced by a microscope, experimenters can import them directly
from the acquisition workstation into the OMERO image repository but, presently, for
this to happen they cannot log out of the workstation until the image data have been
fully transferred out of the workstation into the repository. Thus, other experimenters
will not be able to use the microscope until the import process is finished and the time
it takes to run the import is billed for.
The Background Importer is going to remedy this situation by allowing experimenters to
log out just after triggering the import which will then run autonomously to completion,
thus optimising facility costs and resources usage.
This document provides an overview of the Background Importer project by summarising 
key information about project goals and scope, requirements, solution architecture, 
and project plan.
