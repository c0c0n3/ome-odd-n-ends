Dodging the Combinatorial Bullet
================================

Presentation I gave on 9 Jun 2017 at the OME interview about using simple
algebra to avoid the enumerate & classify trap I get caught in at times
when doing object-oriented design. Parking it here just in case I'll want
to reuse it for something else.

Each SVG file contains a slide---`1.svg` 1st slide, `2.svg` 2nd, etc. To
make it look like the SVG fills the whole browser window, I set document

* `height` and `width` to `100%`
* background colour to `style="background: #3c4747;"`
